## Installation

```bash
# Install the core package
dotnet add package Hangfire.WorkflowCore

# Install ASP.NET Core integration (for HttpContext workflows + automatic dashboard)
dotnet add package Hangfire.WorkflowCore.AspNetCore

# Install dashboard (for standalone dashboard integration)
dotnet add package Hangfire.WorkflowCore.Dashboard

# Install abstractions (if building custom integrations)
dotnet add package Hangfire.WorkflowCore.Abstractions
```

## Quick Example

```csharp
// ASP.NET Core setup with automatic dashboard integration
services.AddHangfireWorkflowCoreAspNetCore(
    hangfire => hangfire.UseMemoryStorage());

// Execute a workflow immediately
var jobId = BackgroundJobWorkflow.Instance
    .Enqueue<VideoProcessingWorkflow, VideoData>(videoData);

// Schedule a workflow with delay
var jobId = BackgroundJobWorkflow.Instance
    .ScheduleWorkflow<VideoProcessingWorkflow, VideoData>(
        videoData, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
```
